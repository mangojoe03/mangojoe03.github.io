    <h1>waves</h1>
    <p>Waves are created by wind blowing across the surface of the sea. The
        size and strength of the waves depend on the wind speed, the distance
        over which the wind blows (fetch), and the duration of the wind. Larger
        waves are typically found in open oceans, while smaller waves are common
        near coastlines. Some waves barrel which means a hole in the wave where the surfer can go 
        through the tube.</p>
